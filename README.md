# NIDSusingML
A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using machine learning is a type of security technology that uses advanced algorithms and statistical models to detect and prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or attacks on computer networks.

The system is trained using historical data to identify patterns and anomalies in network traffic, and to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities. The machine learning algorithms can then be used to identify potential security threats in real-time and trigger alerts or countermeasures to prevent the attack.

Logistic Regression:
     Logistic regression is a statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is useful when the relationship between the input variables and the output is linear or when there are a small number of features.
     
KNN:
     KNN (k-nearest neighbors) is a simple algorithm that classifies an input by finding the k training examples closest to it and assigning the input the most common label among the k neighbors. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that can work well with complex and nonlinear data.
     
Desicion tree:
     Decision trees are a popular algorithm for classification problems. They work by partitioning the input space into regions, each associated with a class label. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both categorical and numerical data.
     
By comparing with these three algorithms, Decision trees are a good choice for problems that have both categorical and numerical data.
